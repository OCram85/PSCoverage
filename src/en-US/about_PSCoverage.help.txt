SHORT DESCRIPTION
        This module provides a simple interface to coveralls.io. It enables you to format your coverage report
        generated by Pester to upload it.

LONG DESCRIPTION
        Unfortunately Pester does not provide any interfaces to upload the coverage reports to external services.
        Therefore this module was developed.

INSTALLING PSCoverage
        The easiest way to install this module is to use the PowerShell built in package management. Therefore use
        `Install-Module 'PSCoverage'` to get the latest release from powershellgallery.com.
